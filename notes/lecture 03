 ## Basics of VSCode
    > Source Control panel--what connects to Git for version control
        after saving a file, can 'commit' from 'staged' with descriptive message
        then, 'sync changes'
## Minimum Requirements for reproducible computational biology
    > annotated data
    > documented code for data analysis
    > defined software environments (versions of software)
    > standardized organization
**1 project = 1 GitHub repository**
        code
        data
            raw, intermediate, tables/figures
        lab notebook
        presentations
        manuscripts
        grants and fellowships
        discussion
    > all contained by project
    > README.md' for overview
    > '.gitignore' to ignore files that shouldn't be tracked by git
        .gz or .fastq
    > '\install' contains software environment
## File organization
    > Naming convention
        files names: no caps, spaces, special characters
        YYYY-MM-DD
        experimental labels in file names
        samples labels with experiment, samples, and replicate
## Tidy data
